# Serve a static index html using Nginx and Docker

<br />

## Background

Some projects does not provide a command to start its app like `npm start`, `yarn start`, or anything that can be executed after the project is built.
Instead, some of them, still provide a build command that generates an index.html inside a production build directory such as `/dist` or `/build`.

This project is based on a tutorial here : 
[How to Serve Static Files with Nginx and Docker - Sabe](https://sabe.io/tutorials/serve-static-files-nginx-docker)
