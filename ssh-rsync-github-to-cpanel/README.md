## ü§î Problems..

Sometimes, **Cpanel ignores GitHub integration** if a directory such as `public_html` is already occupied. 
<br />

- Nevertheless, uploading files such as `view_login.php` one-by-one, that contains updates is not a good practice, in my opinion.
- Another way is to copy the backup of all directories and files, then push all of them in a single repository in GitHub. Although this might be one of the simplest way, I reckon this is time-consuming and quite risky.

<br />

## üí° Proposed solution

I believe one of the quickest and safest solution to this is **to utilize SSH and Rsync through a workflow** such as GitHub workflows in GitHub and GitLab CI in GitLab.

<br />

## üßëüèª‚Äçüîß Steps :

1. Log in to access Cpanel :

<br />

2. Search for SSH :

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/cpanel-ssh.png" />

<br />

3. If you don't have a key, you can generate it by clicking the "Generate Key" button. Otherwise you are allowed to import your keys.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/cpanel-ssh-generate-key-button.png" />

<br />

4. Fill in the columns and generate your public key. Also, ensure that you have secured your SSH key passphrase.

<br />

5. To be able to use it, change the authorization status from **unauthorized** to **authorized**. You can do so by clicking the **manage** button in the public key row.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/cpanel-ssh-authorize-key-1.png" />

6. Make sure you have authorized it.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/cpanel-ssh-authorize-key-2.png" />

<br />

7. Go back and check the authorization status. Make sure it is **authorized**.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/cpanel-ssh-authorize-key-3.png" />

<br />

8. Click the **View/Download** text in the private key row. Download and place it to a secure place.

<br />

It looks like this :

Please do not share your private key so that the server won't be compromised easily.
<br />
Converting to `.ppk` format is not mandatory :

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/cpanel-ssh-convert-to-ppk.png" />

<br />

9. I assume you already have a GiHub repository. Otherwise, please create it and upload your files into the repository.

<br />

10. Go to your repository and click the **Action** tab. This time, we will set up our own workflow so just click the text like in the image below.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/github-set-github-actions.png" />

<br />

After clicked, you will see something like this. GitHub workflow is powered by `.yml` file.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/github-set-github-actions-1.png" />

<br />

11. On the right side of your screen, you see a marketplace. Some people provide templates for workflows. Search **rsync** as our GitHub workflows is powered by Rsync and SSH.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/github-set-github-actions-2.png" />

<br />

Let's shoose [Rsync Deployments Action](https://github.com/Burnett01/rsync-deployments) by [Burnett01](https://github.com/Burnett01).

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/github-set-github-actions-3.png" />

<br />

12. Copy the template by clicking the copy icon.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/jiyu/blob/master/ssh-rsync-github-to-cpanel/assets/github-set-github-actions-4.png" />

<br />

Paste it to your `.yml` (such as `main.yml`) file. It looks like this :

```yml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the dev branch
  push:
    branches: [ dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ dev ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Rsync Deployments Action
      # You may pin to the exact commit or the version.
      # uses: Burnett01/rsync-deployments@b943ffe476f772c90f0199d1a180f068f0206e87
      - uses: Burnett01/rsync-deployments@5.1
        with:
          # The switches
          switches: 
          # The remote shell argument
          rsh: # optional, default is 
          # The local path
          path: # optional, default is 
          # The remote path
          remote_path: 
          # The remote host
          remote_host: 
          # The remote port
          remote_port: # optional, default is 22
          # The remote user
          remote_user: 
          # The remote key
          remote_key: 
          # The remote key passphrase
          remote_key_pass: # optional, default is 
```

You might see wavy red lines that say `This value cannot be null` but it's ok. We will fix them later.

To be able to access webserver, one needs Secure Shell which is well-known as SSH (More: [What is SSH ? - by Search Target](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Shell)).
